# Minimum Viable Governance
This document describes the Minimum Viable Governance of Social Dist0rtion Protocol.

The funds of the DAO are managed by the multi signature wallet deployed in the Main Ethereum Network at the address `0x527621278422FFf45A66f7086bAeAC770CF12b69`

The multi signature wallet defines a *set of owners* and a *number of required confirmations* to execute a transaction.

Anyone can make a **proposal** by opening an issue in any repository of the Social Dist0rtion Protocol organization on GitHub.

The proposal must contain:
- The *problem* being addressed.
- The *solution* proposed.
- An *estimated effort*.
- The *payment conditions*.

The author of the proposal has the responsibility to gauge interest around their work, but it is not an obligation of the DAO to take their work into consideration.

Being `n` the number of confirmations required to execute a transaction:
- A proposal is **accepted** when at least `n` owners vote for it.
- A proposal is **paid** and funds are transferred when at least `n` owners agree that the work has been successfully delivered.
