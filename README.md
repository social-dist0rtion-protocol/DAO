# Introduction
This repository is the home of the Social Dist0rtion Protocol (SDP) Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

SDP's DAO is the combination of:
- **Governance**, that describes the rules by which SDP operates. Those rules can be enforced by the members of SDP and/or by smart contracts.
- A **multisig wallet**, to hold the funds of the DAO.

SDP's governance is defined by a collection of standards called *Dist0rtion Improvement Proposals* (DIPs).
